# Super Six Simulation

[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=clemensbartz_sixwins&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=clemensbartz_sixwins)

This is a simulation for the dice game Super Six. The purpose of this simulation is to show how the odds are stacked in favor of the beginning player. In addition, the performance of implementation alternatives should be highlighted as well.

This project is therefore divided into two parts:

- The [Simulation](simulation.md) portion, which focuses on the game itself.
- The [Performance](performance.md) portion, which focuses on the implementation.
